## Overview

I used Sass for this project. I learnt a lot about using a good file structure, mixins, and functions. I also started using BEM.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I watched a 3 hour video about how to structure my files, didn't fully comprehend it, and then just went for it.
Honestly, as long as I'm working alone, I think whatever I do is fine as long as I know where everything is.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I learnt a lot about how I'd probably have to write code for a serious project. Keeping everything modular is really helpful. I learnt a ton about mixins and functions and how to use them properly. To be fair I probably wasted more time trying to figure out how to write the mixin, than it would have taken me to just manually put in all those properties.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue using Sass, nesting is such a good feature. I'm going to try and learn more about how to structure my files properly.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) - This really helped me with figuring out how to structure my files.
- [px to rem & rpx & vw (cssrem)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cipchk.cssrem) - Amazing vscode extension to convert px to rem and vice versa.
